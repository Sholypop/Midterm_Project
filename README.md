# Midterm_Project
## Machine Model and DashBoard
Building a Machine Model to predict Diamonds prices and a DashBord Visualizing Various important features related to Diamond price.

## Goal:
Model : The Project goal is to build a Machine Model that is capable of predicting the prices of Diamonds.

Visualization : Identify pattern and features most common in Diamonds sales and how they relate with prices.
